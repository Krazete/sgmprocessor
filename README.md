This repository houses the scripts used for extracting resources for my other projects related to Skullgirls Mobile (i.e. /Krazete/sgm and /Krazete/sgmcard).

This project is not officially affiliated with Hidden Variable Studios, so please do not contact for issues concerning the Fighter Gallery or Card Creator.

Moreover, mining the game's APK is generally frowned upon.
This is why all INSTRUCTIONS.md files for learning APK mining have been left out this repository.
